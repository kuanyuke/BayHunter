Here I rewrite the script for preparation of convergence diagnostics test.
The main change is in the parallel.py script. Now it is change into Betweenchains.py.
This new script is used for diff chains to communicate with each other.


Class Parallel Tempering
To do so, first, those models at T=1 should be in the same chain to see if chain at T =1 converge.
(Before I only collected all models at T=1 from whole chains but now want to make all these models at the same chians.)
